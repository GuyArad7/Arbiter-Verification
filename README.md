This is my final project in the course Verification Engineering at Cadence & SQLabs.

The project is a verification environment for the arbiter chip.

The code was written in SystemVerilog and UVM.

Notes:
* The arbiter is described in the file "Arbiter Description.pdf".
* The verification program is described in the file "Arbiter Verification Program.pdf".
* The arbiter DUT isn't included, because it wasn't written by me.
