This is my final project in the course Verification Engineering at Cadence & SQLabs.

The project is a verification program for the arbiter chip.

The code was written in SystemVerilog and UVM.

Notes:
* The arbiter is explained in the file "Arbiter Description.pdf".
* The verification program is explained in the file "Arbiter Verification Program.pdf".
* The arbiter DUT isn't included, because it wasn't written by me.
